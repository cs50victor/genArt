# Procedural-Doughnut
Procedural doughnut using Blender Python API.

# How to run it

- Open `runDoughnut.blend `.
- Run  `main_doughnut.py `.
- The picture will be automatically saved in the same folder.

# Other files
In the same folder you will find also the following files:

1) `Cora.py ` : I have defined here some functions to access the data faster and easier.
2) `Cora.png ` : 2D painted texture for the base of the doughnut (I have made it in blender).
